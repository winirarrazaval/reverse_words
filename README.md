# Reverse words
In this assignment, you'll design and implement one of the string manipulation functions that is commonly asked during interviews.
Remember that a string is an array of characters. Algorithms that worked on restricted arrays will work on strings as well.

## Exercise
* Design and implement a method to reverse each word in a sentence in place. For example, if the method is called with input parameter of "I can be an&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;engineer", the method should update the input string object to have the value "I nac eb na&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reenigne". Note that the count of white spaces between words is preserved.
* Share and explain the time and space complexities for your solution.
* At minimum, your implementation should pass the basic tests.
**Note**: Do not use Ruby provided functionality for `.reverse` and `.reverse!`. You may use `.length`.
